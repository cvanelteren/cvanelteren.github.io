The rapid change from work being at the office now being completely at home came with many challenges such as work-life balance, good ergonomics and ensuring enough exercise to keep your body (and mind) healthy. One thing that gets less attention is the quality of the air your breath. It is well known that increased levels of C02 can reduce cognitive functioning. Increase in fine and coarse dust particles can lead to pulmonary issues and so on. For some time I wanted to get some grip on my local air quality but wasn’t really happy with the options out there for several reasons. First, many sensors do not offer measuring different measures together, for example some sensors may measure temperature and humidity, but not fine dust particles or C02 (or take any combination of the 3). Second, I want to be in control of my own data; I don’t want an attached online service be it free or not, I want to own and export the data. Third, the air quality monitor needs to connect over WiFi for easy interfacing.\nFew weeks ago my interest sparked again after looking at some air filters that IKEA offers and I started exploring the world of air quality monitors. I ended on a DIY solution from a company called AirGradient. They offer a DIY solution that measures C02, temperature, humidity, fine and coarse dust particles. I decided to place an order for PCBs and sourced the parts (they also offer ready made units or kits).\nThe following will describe the build, WiFi connection and hooking it up to prometheus on my server to probe and store the data (similar to Jeff Geerling’s write-up).\nDealing with the different components in this setup was a bit overwhelming; it required combining different (very) mature programs. Although I am not the first to trot in the river of home monitoring, I hope this helps some future person (or me) navigate the space a bit better. It is by no means a complete guide. I will be setting this system up with my shiny new server running TrueNAS Scale (more on that at a different time).\nThe setup The system consists of three components (12):\nAirquality metrics are collected by the airgradient unit C02 Temperature \u0026amp; humidity PM02 and PM10 (dust particulates) The data is read from the airquality monitor and pushed to a data logger (prometheus) The data is visualized as a dashboard (grafana) Abstract layout of the different systems involved Sensor data probing Airgradient provides a github repo with code for reporting on the various air quality metrics. By default it can push to an external dashboard hosted by airgradient. However, since I want to self-host, we have to edit the code a bit. In order to expose the sensor data, we have to do two things:\nSetup a server Write handlers for: Payload Not handles requests To setup the server, we have to download and include the ESP8266 web server to serve the sensor data. Next, we advertise the data as a json file. The following edits are added to the code to achieve this.\n//... #include \u0026lt;ESP8266WebServer.h\u0026gt; // setup server const int port = 80; ESP8266WebServer server(port); String createPayload(){ // ignore data if it possess negative values return \u0026#34;{\\\u0026#34;wifi\\\u0026#34;:\u0026#34; + String(WiFi.RSSI()) + (Co2 \u0026lt; 0 ? \u0026#34;\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;, \\\u0026#34;rco2\\\u0026#34;:\u0026#34; + String(Co2)) + (pm25 \u0026lt; 0 ? \u0026#34;\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;, \\\u0026#34;pm02\\\u0026#34;:\u0026#34; + String(pm25)) + (TVOC \u0026lt; 0 ? \u0026#34;\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;, \\\u0026#34;tvoc_index\\\u0026#34;:\u0026#34; + String(TVOC)) + (NOX \u0026lt; 0 ? \u0026#34;\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;, \\\u0026#34;nox_index\\\u0026#34;:\u0026#34; + String(NOX)) + \u0026#34;, \\\u0026#34;atmp\\\u0026#34;:\u0026#34; + String(temp) + (hum \u0026lt; 0 ? \u0026#34;\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;, \\\u0026#34;rhum\\\u0026#34;:\u0026#34; + String(hum)) + \u0026#34;}\u0026#34;; } void sendPayload(){ String payload = createPayload(); server.send(200, \u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34;, payload); }; void handleNotFound(){ server.send(404, \u0026#34;text/plain\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Not Found\u0026#34;); }; // setup server void setup(){ // ... other stuff // setup server server.on(\u0026#34;/metrics\u0026#34;, sendPayload); server.onNotFound(handleNotFound); server.begin(); } // edit loop to process events void loop { // ... server.handleClient(); // process on events } Prometheus For prometheus the airgradient unit has to expose a `/metrics` url. I modified the airgradient code to expose the sensor values which can then be read by prometheus. Getting prometheus installed was easily done through the TrueNAS interface, however, it was completely unclear how to load the metrics into the interface. When prometheus is booted up, you are greeted with a rather blank looking interface. There is a command-like prompt that you can probe. I assumed initially that the interface would allow me to point to a particular url to fetch the data. This wasn’t the case (or at least I was not able to figure it out).\nWith TrueNAS, you can smoothly install apps and quickly toggle some settings to configure a package. However, when things become more involved, I find the system a bit limiting. For example, the tutorials on Prometheus requires one to edit a config json file to setup where it can fetch data from.

Years ago I was on the journey to create a webpage, but was quickly sucked into the endless possibilities of web design. Should I go for Vue.js, REACT, or maybe a different web programming language such as svelte or supersets of javascript such as typescipt. Possibilities are endless, but for those starting out it is a daunting undertaking.\nEnter website generators that take away the initial pain of designing layouts for websites. These generators provide a batteries included approach to the web, offering you a landing page with some optional widgets that gets you started on creating a personalized corner of the web. I too started out in this manner. Years ago, I wanted a web page that would help reflect my academic endeavors. The portfolio would need to consist of talks, links to slides and or papers. Hugo academic was the generator I used for web design. For years Hugo academic work perfectly well. However, as time passed my page began to feel stale and I wanted to display something more exciting on my page. Websites become more capable of running full fledged apps and more and more standalone software was pushed to have a web component. I felt like I was left behind. You see, using a generator kicks off the process of getting a website. However, it did not gave me insights in how the website was generated. I still felt like I was stuck at square one. As such I slowly began to interface with the code that was generated. I started first with customization and later on created a site navigator with networks in javascript. I was starting to web design!\nAll things changed, however, when Hugo Academic was re-branded to Wowchemy. The change in name was reflected with a change in design. Every now and again when I wanted to write a new post, my website would be faced with upgrading issues. Especially since my code base originated from Hugo Academic. My need for customization grew and grew, but my frustration with the process of wowchemy did too. I am currently faced with a dilemma; I either decide to leave the framework behind, and create something from scratch or I figure out how to effectively interface with wowchemy such that I can work with it more pleasently.\nSite 2.0 Enter site 2.0; on the surface I does not look any different from my old website except some rounded corners here and there. Under the hood, however, I am able to more deeply change the feel of the webpages.\nGoals First, I wanted to change the look and feel of some widgets on the web page. Wowchemy calls these nowadays “blocks”. The process of changing these pages is a bit ill-documented so I am here to outline what my current understanding is of how wowchemy blocks can be modified to your hearts desire. I started out by just plain googling and found a post by A.J. Campell which was greatly helpful and I copied his landing design (here). But let’s first decide on some goals.\nI want to understand how I can modify the look and feel of my website I want to be able to control and extend the look and feel of my website Note 2 is implied by 1 but is not necessary a consequence of 1.\nCustomizing a block A web page consists of different elements that can be blocked by `divs`. Wowchemy organizes a webpage with widgets called blocks. The blocks are pre-defined views of content such as a portfolio, landing page, how posts are viewed (you get the drift). To customize a block we need to create a new directory from the root folder of our site as\nmkdir -p layouts/partials/blocks/v1 I don’t know why they called it v1, but it implies that they are going to change this in the future again (and I will probably write a post about it again). Now the reasoning is as follows, when you build your site, wowchemy pulls default templates from repos and puts them in the public folder which constitutes your website. If a local path if present, the local edit will take precedence over the default template. You will override the template. In past iterations of wowchemy this process was under `./layouts/partials/widgets/`, and the structure of the go code inside these folders was also different. At the time over writing for version v5.7, the blocks structure is what should be aimed for. One can take the default templates, and edit the html files to change the look and feel of the website, and one can also create new blocks to extend your website: mission accomplished.\nConcluding statements This is a pretty short post with a seemingly simple statement. However, from the user perspective it was a little tricky figuring this out. My website was working before with edits using and older version of wowchemy. Every X updates it seems like the updates break things that need not have fixing. It would be nice if their documentation is edited to walk …","date":1684506884,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684506884,"objectID":"2bb97dcb192aaa7ddf2c9c87124341f5","permalink":"https://cvanelteren.github.io/post/customizing-wowchemy/","publishdate":"2023-05-19T16:34:44+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/customizing-wowchemy/","section":"post","summary":"Fixing some annoyances on my website","tags":[],"title":"Customizing Wowchemy","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"A friend and I walked over 100 KM on arguably one of the prettiest walked so far.

I implemented a chicken in cpp and provided bindings in cython and python. However, our chicken Carl needs some friends. Today, I will implement a friend for Carl, in another morer niche language called nim; and I will show how nim can produce similarly fast chickens that can be called from python.\nWhat is Nim? From their website:\nNim is a statically typed compiled systems programming language. It combines succesful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula\nI am not familiar with the latter two, but I am quite familiar with python and it can be used to solve one of python’s weaknesses: python can be terribly slow for numerical problems.\nWriting nim is similar to other modern languages like rust: it prefers inheritance over composition. However, it does not shy away from using “more” traditional methods. For example, in nim “classes” are called types and types can be composed (preferred) but can also inheret from oneanother. Which allows more ancient programmers like me to be able to use my toolset while also exploring composition more.\nWriting nim looks very similar to python. Variables defined with the var keyword, functions are proc (process), printing is performed with echo, classes / structs are types and so on.\nVariables are typed, however the compiler is often very good at inferring the type you are assigning. This effectively means that defining a variable as\nvar x = 1 var x: int = 1 is the same, and var can be seen as implicitly using the auto keyword from cpp. For more details on nim see their excellent tutorial on the website; let’s start making our chicken friend!\nNim chickens Classes are called types. As want to bind to python, we make use of the nimpy library from nim. Fellow pythonistas should feel right at home\n# import a package as per usual of python import nimpy # types are \u0026#34;classes\u0026#34; # they are similar to structs type Chicken = ref object of PyNimObjectExperimental name: string We have defined our chicken type, the ref object makes sure that our types inherents from the root object that makes sure our chicken can be imported from python. As can be seen from the name, this features is experimental. Functions are readily exportable to python, but types have only recently been added in. Not to worry, it will hopefully improve over time.\nNim implementation Similar, to our previous chicken Carl, we want our chicken to do something\n# on the structs we can define methods proc set_name(self: Chicken, value : string) {.exportpy.}= self.name = value proc get_name(self: Chicken): string {.exportpy.}= self.name proc peck(self: Chicken): void {.exportpy.} = echo \u0026#34;Peck peck!\u0026#34; There is a lot going on in this piece, so let’s step through it. The proc keyword is similar to def in python: it defines our function. Similar to type hinting our return type is given after the :. Nim, similar to other languages like matlab, implictly defines a result variable; return keywords are not necessary and last lines without assignment are automatically put into result. For example\nproc some_test(x: float): float = result = x proc some_test_other(x: float): float = return x proc some_test_another(x: float): float = x are equivalent. The curly brackets indicate compiler directives; {.exportpy.} tells the compiler to make these functions available in our shared object.\nCompilation All that is left to do is to compile our chicken into a shared object and import it.\nnim cpp -d:release --threads:on --app:lib --out:chicken.so chicken.nim and, we are done! This is less boilerplate code than the cython approach. Compared to cython, nimpy is less mature. However, nim can readily interact with native c/cpp. It’s mainly immature in the type export, but I hope that will improve in the future. It does form a nice alternative to more “verbose” cpp; it writes quite similar to python. Just to finish of the end, let’s run our litle chicken\n#file: test_nim.py from chicken import Chicken c = Chicken() c.set_name(\u0026#34;Betsy\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;My name is {c.get_name()}\u0026#34;) for i in range(10): c.peck() generates\nMy name is Betsy Peck peck! Peck peck! Peck peck! Peck peck! Peck peck! Peck peck! Peck peck! Peck peck! Peck peck! Peck peck! Betsy and Carl can now life together in python world, but they can also interact together in nim or cpp world.\nThe nim-farm So far we have been able to bind the nim type to python. Carl and Betsy can life happily ever after there. Nim is, however, also compiled. So we can also inhabit our little farm purely on the cpp side. This will look as follows:\n{.compile: \u0026#34;../cython_classes/chicken.cpp\u0026#34;.} type CChicken* {.header: \u0026#34;../cython_classes/chicken.hpp\u0026#34;, importcpp: \u0026#34;Chicken\u0026#34;.} = object name: cstring proc peck*(this: CChicken) {.header: \u0026#34;../cython_classes/chicken.hpp\u0026#34;, importcpp: \u0026#34;#.peck(@)\u0026#34;.} # var chick = CChicken() var cchick = CChicken(name: \u0026#34;Carl\u0026#34;) var nchick = Chicken(name: \u0026#34;Betsy\u0026#34;) echo \u0026#34;We have two chickens now, introducing:\u0026#34; echo nchick.name echo …","date":1624643275,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624643275,"objectID":"c523e45c1d30f06d447c2daa81779222","permalink":"https://cvanelteren.github.io/post/nim_chicken/","publishdate":"2021-06-25T19:47:55+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/nim_chicken/","section":"post","summary":"In a previous post, I created the fastest chicken alive!

There is however one big downside: python can be painfully slow for numerical applications. One possible solution is to write extensions in lower-level languages and provide bindings that one can use from python. This is often referred to as the two-language-problem as it requires a programmer to know two languages. In this post I will explore cython which is “half” language that allows to write both native python and c/cpp in one file. In particular, I will focus on binding cpp classes to python to extend python libraries to python.\nCython In a nutshell, cython allows a programmer to write python-like code that is then compiled into c/cpp. This can be used to write high performant extensions. The goal of this post is not to provide a novice tutorial; for those interested cython’s documentation provides some great material for that. This post will focus mainly on providing bindings of cpp to python.\nCPP class Imagine we want to write an extremely fast chicken, and we have decided python is not suitable for this. We turn to cpp and write something like\n// file: chicken.hpp #ifndef chicken_hpp #define chicken_hpp #include \u0026lt;iostream\u0026gt; class Chicken { public: Chicken(); Chicken(std::string name); std::string name; void peck(); }; #endif We start implementing straight away and end up with something like:\n// file: chicken.cpp #include \u0026#34;chicken.hpp\u0026#34; Chicken::Chicken() { this-\u0026gt;name = \u0026#34;HELP I HAVE NO NAME\u0026#34;; } Chicken::Chicken(std::string name) { this-\u0026gt;name = name; } void Chicken::peck() { std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Peck peck!\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; std::endl; } Our chicken is alive, but it is stuck in cpp world. We have to get it running in python. How do we start doing this? In order to order to create a python chicken class, we have to provide a wrapper. In cython, we achieve this in two steps. First, we need to tell cython what cpp object we are looking at. Second, we need to create a cython extenions that provides bindings for python.\nCython header Just like in cpp, cython has a header/implementation style system. The headers are kept in pxd files and the implementation are in pyx files. For our headers, we merely have to provide implementations on our cpp class methods. Cython offers three kinds; standard python def implementations, cpdef, and cdef methods. The last two are special kinds; cpdef methods allow for seamless interaction between “python-world” and “cpp-world”. In contrast, cdef methods only allow for interaction with cpp objects. For this current tutorial, this distinction is not necessary, and we can go straight ahead with implementing our chicken.\nWe need to tell cython what our cpp class looks like. We create a header file cychicken.pxd with the following content\n#file cychicken.pxd from libcpp.string cimport string cdef extern from \u0026#34;chicken.hpp\u0026#34;: cdef cppclass Chicken: Chicken() except+ Chicken(string name) except+ string name void peck() The first line imports the cython implementation of string (which is merely a wrapper for std::string), cdef extern is similar to extern in c/cpp: it tells cython that there is an external header. We then “color in” the header and tell cython what objects life in this header. In our case, we have a chicken! And importantly, this chicken has a name and it can peck (be careful!).\nCython implementation We now have implemented our class in cpp and defined headers for the class in cpp and cython. At this point, we could cimport the Chicken class and within cdef and cpdef classes can interact with this cpp class. However, we cannot yet import our chicken class into python directly. In order to do this, we have to provide an implementation (wrapper) for the python side to interact with.\n#file: cychicken.pyx from cychicken cimport Chicken, string cdef class PyChicken: # defines class property # can be put into pxd files cdef Chicken *cpp_chicken # normal class init def __init__(self, name: str): # need to convert string to binary # for cpp strings self.cpp_chicken = new Chicken(f\u0026#34;{name}\u0026#34;.encode(\u0026#39;utf8\u0026#39;)) # ensures that point is deleted when object is # destroyed def __dealloc__(self): del self.cpp_chicken # wrap the peck function def peck(self): self.cpp_chicken.peck() # wrap the name property @property def name(self): return self.cpp_chicken.name.decode(\u0026#39;utf8\u0026#39;) Our chicken can now freely be called from python!\nCompiling Before we can test our chicken, we have to write some code to compile it into a shared object. Setting up a proper extension is some black magic in and of itself. I won’t bore you with the details today and for now you can merely create a setup file as such\n#file: setup.py from setuptools import setup from Cython.Build import cythonize from setuptools.extension import Extension exts = [ Extension( \u0026#34;chicken\u0026#34;, sources=[\u0026#34;cychicken.pyx\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;chicken.cpp\u0026#34;], include_dirs=[\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;], language=\u0026#34;c++\u0026#34;, ) ] setup(ext_modules=cythonize(exts)) Running python setup.py build_ext …","date":1624474758,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624474758,"objectID":"3090dbdddef851274dbf01003d0f4d86","permalink":"https://cvanelteren.github.io/post/cython_classes/","publishdate":"2021-06-23T20:59:18+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/cython_classes/","section":"post","summary":"Wrapping cpp in cython and python","tags":["coding","cython","cpp","chickens"],"title":"Creating the fastest chicken alive!","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Understanding dynamical systems is a fundamental problem for the 21st century.

The language is easy to develop in, which allows for quick proto-typing. It is used by many professional companies either as glue to bind compiled languages together, or as a full-stack for their apps. With the advent of python 3.6 and [[pep498][https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/]] f-strings arrived. Its longer name is formatted string literals or f-strings for short ;-). This is probably one of my favorite python feature next to dicts being sorted by default.\nWhat are f-strings? When you are either debugging or writing some logging library, strings (in my opinion) were always a hassle to deal with. In order to write the output of a variable one would either write\nsome_variable = \u0026#34;hello world!\u0026#34; print(\u0026#34;Some variable = \u0026#34; + some_variable) print(\u0026#34;Some variable = %s\u0026#34;.format(some_variable)) The top choice is not that bad, but the bottom one gets complicated when formatting get more complex. With F-strings this procedure can be simplified by writing:\nsome_variable = \u0026#34;hello world!\u0026#34; print(f\u0026#34;Some variable = {some_variable}\u0026#34;) Merely by adding the formatting operator “f” in front of the string, the output becomes more readble. This has the advantage of literate programming; in plain langauge one can read this sentence and understand its output in normal plain language. Since the feature became available I quickly replaced the old formatting style with this newer better way: f-strings became the norm.\nIn my normal debugging routine, I am not used to using full-featured debuggers that can step in and out of functions allowing to see local scopes: very fancy! I usually resort to print statements, and lots of coffee and pacing around my room. F-strings allowed for quicker and clearer debugging. This prompts me to write this post now, what else can F-strings do?\nCapabilities of f-strings F-strings can do a great number of things. One of the major advantages for me is making readable strings as was indicated above.\nFormatting F-strings allow for formatting opertors to be passed in. Say you have a float with 10 decimes but you only want to plot the rounded number. One option would be to do:\na = 1.23123512351234 print(f\u0026#34;{round(a, 2)}\u0026#34;) This however, quickly makes the f-string “complicated”. Luckliy f-strings allow for format operators to be used\na = 1.23123512351234 print(f\u0026#34;{a:.2f}\u0026#34;) # prints up to 2 precision Next to rouding formats, one can also apply alignment of text\ntext = \u0026#34;hello world\u0026#34; print(f\u0026#34;{text: \u0026gt;}\u0026#34;) # right align print(f\u0026#34;{text: \u0026lt;}\u0026#34;) # left align [default often] print(f\u0026#34;{text: ^}\u0026#34;) # center align There are many more possibilites, including aligning only if the text goes bigger than a certain predetermined number of digits or formatting numbers to hex, binary, leading space for positive numbers and so on. In fact there is a minilanguage that it uses that can be found on the python docs.\nLambda functions The colon is used for formatting indicator. This prevents lambda functions from being used directly. However, by encapsulating the lambda function one is still able to insert lambda functions inside an f-string.\nprint(f\u0026#34;This is the output of two times 2 {(lambda x: x*2)(2)}\u0026#34;) Debugging In debugging I often revert to writing the output to check the state of some object. This results in boilerplate statements that I wish to prevent. Luckily, f-strings can to this with = formatting.\nsome_variables = \u0026#34;ERROR!\u0026#34; print(f\u0026#34;{some_variable=}\u0026#34;) will print out\nsome_variable = \u0026#34;ERROR\u0026#34; Pretty neat! This reduces the need to write out the variable statement completely.\n","date":1623220486,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623220486,"objectID":"444e0f6ed68f9c0ea80a123e763905af","permalink":"https://cvanelteren.github.io/post/f-strings/","publishdate":"2021-06-09T08:34:46+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/f-strings/","section":"post","summary":"If you know python, you are probably aware of its value.

The transition was coupled with a lack of initial support for receiving email with this security protocol yielding some email clients useless. The goal of this post is to provide future users with some insights on setting up OAUTH2 in mu4e.\nWhat is OAUTH2? In brief, OAUTH2 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts through an HTTP service; applications can request access to user accounts by setting up a host-client secret. In my mind it works similar to ssh, but then for email.\nSetting up OAUTH2 in emacs We need to achieve 3 functions; we need to acquire a secret, use this secret to receive the emails, use this secret to send the emails. As an important aside, it is highly recommended to set up some form of password management such that your passwords are not visible of left strangling in clipboard; setting this up is outside the scope of this post.\nAcquiring the secret Acquiring the secret may differ depending on the service you are using. For gmail for example look here. For office 365 however, it proved a bit more difficult as I did not have access directly to the api to setup these keys through azure. In order to acquire a secret I used mutt_oauth2.py, and I used the publically available application id for thunderbird which can be found here. At the time of writing these are\nAppID = \u0026#34;08162f7c-0fd2-4200-a84a-f25a4db0b584\u0026#34; ClientSecret = \u0026#34;TxRBilcHdC6WGBee]fs?QR:SJ8nI[g82\u0026#34; Acquire mutt_oauth2.py and edit the code with this info. Running the file will then give you a token after logging in with the through your SSO of your company. Now this token is put in a public file, anyone who has acces to this token could theoretically scoop your email. It is therefore crucial to setup a password manager to protect this secret.\nEmail receiving I use mbsync for receiving emails and mstmp for sending emails. I again defer to the respective tutorials for setting these up, but I will mention what is important for XOAUTH2. A common setup for mbsync could look something like this\n#file: ~/.mbsyncrc # mbsyncrc based on # http://www.ict4g.net/adolfo/notes/2014/12/27/EmacsIMAP.html # ACCOUNT INFORMATION IMAPAccount office365 # Address to connect to Host smtp.office365.com User \u0026lt;EMAIL_HERE\u0026gt; PassCmd \u0026#34;gpg2 -q --for-your-eyes-only --no-tty -d ~/.emacs.d/mu4e/.mbsyncpass-\u0026lt;EMAIL_HERE\u0026gt;.gpg\u0026#34; AuthMechs LOGIN SSLType IMAPS SSLVersions TLSv1.3 CertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt IMAPStore office365 Account office365 MaildirStore office365-local SubFolders Verbatim # The trailing \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; is important Path ~/Mail/ Inbox ~/Mail/office365/inbox Channel office365 Far :office365-remote: Near :office365-local: # Exclude everything under the internal [Gmail] folder, except the interesting folders Patterns * ![office365]* \u0026#34;[office365]/Sent Mail\u0026#34; \u0026#34;[office365]/Starred\u0026#34; \u0026#34;[office365]/All Mail\u0026#34; # Or include everything #Patterns * # Automatically create missing mailboxes, both locally and on the server Create Both # Save the synchronization state files in the relevant directory SyncState * PassCmd is used to obtain your client secret setup above and Authmechs needs to be set to XOAUTH2 for office365 but oddly to LOGIN for gmail. One could also fill in a bare string password to prevent the hassle of setting up password managers, or use python mutt_oauth2.py TOKENFILE to acquire the secret but this is not recommended. We can check whether it works by running mbsync -a from your favorite shell.\nEmail sending Similar to the setup of mbsync, msmtp can be setup to use a password command to insert the token. Note that you need to have a version that supports xoauth2, on AUR you can use mstmp-oauth2. A typical setup looks like this\n#file : ~/.mstmprc # Set default values for all following accounts. defaults auth on tls on tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt logfile ~/.msmtp.log # Outlook account outlook host smtp.office365.com port 587 auth xoauth2 from username@outlook.com # not necessary # user username # not recommended password plain-text-password # recommended passwordeval \u0026lt;Password retrieval command\u0026gt; ... # Set a default account (optional) account default : outlook We can now receive and send email. As coup de grâce we have to setup mu4e to start using email from emacs.\nMu4e At the time of writing I am using doom emacs which has some wrappers for common long commands; substitute for default emacs accordingly. “Modern” mu4e uses contexts to setup various emails addresses. I will highlight the relevant parts for mu4e setup to make our setup work. In short, we need to tell mu use mbsync to retrieve emails and msmtp to send emails.\n(after! mu4e (setq ;; set correct path sendmail-program \u0026#34;/usr/sbin/msmtp\u0026#34; mu4e-root-maildir \u0026#34;~/Mail\u0026#34; mu4e-mu4e-mail-path \u0026#34;~/Mail\u0026#34; send-mail-function \u0026#39;smtpmail-send-it ;; remove adding username --\u0026gt; msmtp takes care of this message-sendmail-f-is-evil t ;; read who …","date":1619165547,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619165547,"objectID":"b5db59d63cb81e98eea1243377d6c6fc","permalink":"https://cvanelteren.github.io/post/mu4e/","publishdate":"2021-04-23T10:12:27+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/mu4e/","section":"post","summary":"Setting up mu4e for office 365 with OAUTH2","tags":["emacs","coding"],"title":"Growing pains","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Covid “dashboard” I made over the winter.

For municipality $j$ the relative severity for source $s_i \\in \\{\\textrm{total reported, hospitalized, deceased}\\}$ at time $t$ was computed as\n$$ R_j(s_{ij}^t) = \\frac{1}{Z_j \\sum_k R_k(s_i^t)}\\sum_{\\tau =0}^t s_{ij}^{\\tau},$$\nwere $Z_j$ is the number of people living in municipality $j$, and $s_{ij}$ is one of the sources (total cases, hospitalized, deceased) in municipality $j$. The percentile of $R_j(s_i^t)$ at each time $t$ is then computed and plotted above.\n","date":1618508291,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618508291,"objectID":"f870a9699be09eb7fc75102f4beab828","permalink":"https://cvanelteren.github.io/project/covid_dashboard/","publishdate":"2021-04-15T19:38:11+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/covid_dashboard/","section":"project","summary":"How the pandemic spread through the Netherlands.

Some time ago I saw a post on fixing matplotlib colorbars by Joseph Lang. One of the major problems with matplotlib is that it works quite well out of the box, until it doesn’t. Making figures for publication just right can become tedious as shown by Joseph Lang as it requires one deep into the docs and figuring something simple like aligning colorbars to axes.\nAfter browsing stackoverflow I was triggered by a post that seemed to achieve something somewhat trivial but the proposed solution seemed too difficult. The problem posted by original poster described how the goal was to update the colorbar in animations of a heatmap. Animating in matplotlib can be super slow, if some tricks are not known to the end-user. Examples include blitting, preventing large object reconstruction, setting data structures manually, drawing canvas etc.\nAfter digging through the docs I figured out that in order to prevent manually updating the colorbar, one needs to force update of the map afterwhich the colorbar will be updated:\nfrom matplotlib.pyplot import subplots from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation from matplotlib import rc from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import make_axes_locatable from IPython.display import HTML rc(\u0026#39;animation\u0026#39;, html = \u0026#39;html5\u0026#39;) import numpy as np, threading # define data d = np.random.randn(10, 10) # setup figure fig, ax = subplots(figsize = \\ (4,4)) divider = make_axes_locatable(ax) cax = divider.append_axes(\u0026#34;right\u0026#34;, \\ size = \u0026#34;5%\u0026#34;,\\ pad = .1) # J.

The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams.
