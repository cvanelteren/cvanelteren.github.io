A value network is a set of roles  that connect together to form a network. Take
a coffee company for example, in order for a customer to buy a bag of beans, the
coffee company  has to go  through a series  of steps to  get the coffee  to its
customers. In the case of actual goods, these networks are called supply chains.
In a  general sense,  one can  dub the  divions of  role within  some functional
context as  a value network. That  is, a value network  is a graph in  which the
vertices represent an abstract role. The connectivity between these roles are an
abstract embodiment of how these roles interact together.

A value  network by  itself can  form a  valuable tool  in analysis  in business
decomposing how  a business is organized.  However, I wondered, can  we get more
out  of this  tool? In  particular,  can this  concept  can be  used for  complex
systems? Complex systems that most notable lack a central controller and are often
associated with "emergent behavior" (more on in some future post). Entities in a
complex system interact together, but their  roles may not be represented simply
by its "self-ness". Rather,  it is possible that the entity  operates as a role,
which in "role space" has specific known interactions. 

This idea, I employed in social settings. Given a social network, one can encode
a particular known value network and look for its temporal properties.
