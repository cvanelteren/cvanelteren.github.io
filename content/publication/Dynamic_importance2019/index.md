abstract: 'One of the most central questions in network science is: which nodes are
  most important? Often this question is answered using topological properties such
  as high connectedness or centrality in the network. However it is unclear whether
  topological connectedness translates directly to dynamical impact. To this end,
  we simulate the kinetic Ising spin model on generated and a real-world networks
  with weighted edges. The extent of the dynamic impact is assessed by causally intervening
  on a node state and effect on the systemic dynamics. The results show that topological
  features such as network centrality or connectedness are actually poor predictors
  of the dynamical impact of a node on the rest of the network. A solution is offered
  in the form of an information theoretical measure named information impact. The
  metric is able to accurately reflect dynamic importance of nodes in networks under
  natural dynamics using observations only, and validated using causal interventions.
  We conclude that the most dynamically impactful nodes are usually not the most well-connected
  or central nodes. This implies that the common assumption of topologically central
  or well-connected nodes being also dynamically important is actually false, and
  abstracting away the dynamics from a network before analyzing is not advised.'

summary: A common assumption is that well-connectedness of agents translates to dynamic
  importance. In this paper I show how this assertion is in fact false, and we cannot
  abstract away from dynamics before analyzing complex systems
