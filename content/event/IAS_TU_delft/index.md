  abstract: 'One of the most central questions in network science is: which nodes
    are most important? Often this question is answered using topological properties
    such as high connectedness or centrality in the network. However it is unclear
    whether topological connectedness translates directly to dynamical impact. To
    this end, we simulate the kinetic Ising spin model on generated and a real-world
    networks with weighted edges. The extent of the dynamic impact is assessed by
    causally intervening on a node state and effect on the systemic dynamics. The
    results show that topological features such as network centrality or connectedness
    are actually poor predictors of the dynamical impact of a node on the rest of
    the network. A solution is offered in the form of an information theoretical measure
    named information impact. The metric is able to accurately reflect dynamic importance
    of nodes in networks under natural dynamics using observations only, and validated
    using causal interventions. We conclude that the most dynamically impactful nodes
    are usually not the most well-connected or central nodes. This implies that the
    common assumption of topologically central or well-connected nodes being also
    dynamically important is actually false, and abstracting away the dynamics from
    a network before analyzing is not advised.'

I was a guest speaker as part of the course Modeling and Data Analysis in Complex Networks.
Additionally, the same slides were shown at the simulation based science group at the institute
for advanced studies (IAS) at the university of Amsterdam.
The talk concerned my research on the identification of driver-nodes in complex dynamical systems.
