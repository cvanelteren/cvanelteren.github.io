Understanding dynamical systems  is a fundamental problem for  the 21st century.
Despite the _prima facie_ differences  and purposes of many real-world networks,
previous research shows several universal characteristics in networks properties
such as the small-world phenomenon, fat-tail degree and feedback loops. This has
lead to  the common but  often implicit assumption  that the connectedness  of a
node in  the network is proportional  to its dynamic importance.  For example in
epidemic  research, high  degree nodes  or "super-spreaders"  are associated  to
dominant  epidemic  risk and  therefore  deserve  special attention.  Yet  prior
research shows  that the shared  universality in network characteristics  is not
shared in the dynamic or functional properties of many real-world systems.

In  this  talk I  will  explore  the  relation  between local  interactions  and
macroscopic properties of  a system through the lens of  statistical physics and
information theory. In particular, I will  show novel methods on determining the
so-called driver node  in complex systems, and how tipping  point can be studied
from an information theoretical perspective.
